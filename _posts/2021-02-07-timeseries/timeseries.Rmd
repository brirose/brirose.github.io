## Overview

As part of a class project, I worked with Jaleise Hall, Minnie Ringland to create time series of salmon at Willamette Falls.

Hydroelectric power represents an important renewable and low-emissions energy source, but the construction and development of the water source that the power plants can require sometimes threatens resident fish populations. Willamette Falls, located outside of Portland in northwestern Oregon (see map below), is an important traditional Native American fishing ground. To protect this natural resource and aid the passage of salmon and steelhead runs over the falls, fishways have been constructed and updated over time. Daily fish counts are monitored to ensure that migration of these fish populations continues to be unhindered by the power plant and the falls. This report summarizes findings from studying Willamette Falls monitoring data from 2001 to 2010.

willamette_salmon <- read_csv(here("_posts", "2021-02-07-timeseries","data", "willamette_fish_passage.csv")) %>%  # read in data

               names_to = "species",

```

### Original time series

```{r fig.cap="Timeseries showing Coho (green), Jack Coho (blue), and Steelhead (yellow) salmon counts at Willamette Falls from 2001 to 2010. Seasonal and specific variation is apparent."}

ggplot(salmon_longer, aes(x = date,
                          y = counts, 
                          color = species)) + # make ggplot
  geom_line() + #as a lineplot
  labs(x = "Year", # add labs
       y = "Count",
       title = "Salmon counts at Willamette Falls fish passage",
       subtitle = "2001 - 2010",
       caption = "Bri Baker, 2021\nSource: Columbia River DART",
       color = "Species") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("aquamarine3", "cornflowerblue", "goldenrod1")) + # change colors
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", # show all years
               date_labels = "%Y") +
  theme_minimal() + # use theme_minimal
  theme(legend.position = c(0.15, 0.75), # move legend
        legend.background = element_rect(fill="white", 
                                         linetype = "solid",
                                         color = "whitesmoke"), # format legend
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30,
                                   vjust = 1, 
                                   hjust = 1)) # angle x labels

```


#### Takeaways

* The most apparent pattern in the data is seasonality on an annual basis, with peak sightings occurring mid-year.
* The bulk of Steelhead movement occurs earlier in the year than that of Coho and Jack Coho.
* Coho increased in abundance over the time studied, particularly in 2009 and 2010.


### Seasonplots 

```{r fig.cap= "This plot shows the monthly averaged seasonal salmon counts for each of the salmon species observed at Willamette Falls Fish. Colored lines represent the different years of observation between 2001 - 2010."}
salmon_season <- salmon_longer %>% 
  index_by(yy_mm = ~yearmonth(.)) %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarize(monthly_mean_counts = mean(counts, 
                                       na.rm = TRUE)) # get monthly averages by species

salmon_season %>% 
  gg_season(monthly_mean_counts) +
  scale_color_gradient2(labels = seq(2000, 2010, 1),
                        breaks = seq(0,10,1),
                        low = "goldenrod1", 
                        mid = "aquamarine3", 
                        high = "cornflowerblue",
                        midpoint = 5)+
  labs(title = "Mean Seasonal Salmon Counts at Willamette Falls Fish Passage",
       y = "Average Counts",
       x = "",
       subtitle = "2001 - 2010",
       caption = "Jaleise Hall, 2021\nSource: Columbia River DART") +
  theme_minimal()
  

```


```{r fig.cap= "The plot takes the monthly averaged seasonal salmon counts and separates them by month to show individual trends occuring for a single month by the corresponding species."}
salmon_season %>% 
  gg_subseries(monthly_mean_counts) +
  labs(title = "Mean Montly Seasonal Salmon Counts at Willamette Falls Fish \nPassage",
       y = "",
       x = "",
       subtitle = "2001 - 2010",
       caption = "Jaleise Hall, 2021\nSource: Columbia River DART") +
  scale_x_yearmonth(date_labels = "20%y", # %y only add the last two digits of the year. 
                  date_breaks = "3 years") # show every 3 years to look cleaner
  #NOTE: I did not add theme_minimal() to the subseries plot as it makes the plot look a bit messy in my opinion

```


#### Takeaways

* Both the seasonplot and subseries plot make the seasonal difference in peak sightings for each species apparent. As gathered from the original time series, Steelheads are observed year round, but peak in early summer (July). Conversely, Coho and Jack Coho are not frequently observed until their peak in the fall (Aug - Nov).
* There is a decreasing trend in Steelhead abundance from 2001 - 2010. While there is increased abundance of Jack Coho and Coho salmon, the changes in abundance seem random as opposed to following a clear trend.
* Average peak counts of salmon are much higher for Steelhead and Coho than for Jack Coho.


### Annual counts by species

```{r fig.cap="Annual timeseries showing Coho (green), Jack Coho (blue), and Steelhead (yellow) salmon counts at Willamette Falls from 2001 to 2010."}

# Using Bri's "pivot_longer-ed" df:
annual <- salmon_longer %>%
  group_by_key() %>% # group by species
  index_by(yr = ~year(.)) %>% # index by year
  summarize(annual_count = sum(counts)) %>% # sum counts by year and species
  mutate(yr = as.Date(ISOdate(yr, 1, 1)))


# Using Bri's graph formatting:
ggplot(data = annual, aes(x = yr, 
                          y = annual_count, 
                          color = species)) +
  geom_line(size=1.25) +
  labs(x = "Year",
       y = "Count",
       title = "Salmon counts at Willamette Falls fish passage by year",
       subtitle = "2001 - 2010",
       color = "Species",
       caption = "Minnie Ringland, 2021\nSource: Columbia River DART") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("aquamarine3", "cornflowerblue", "goldenrod1")) + # change colors
  scale_x_date(date_breaks = "1 year", 
               date_labels = "%Y") + # show all years in YYYY format
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.75, 0.75), # move legend
        legend.background = element_rect(fill="white", 
                                         linetype = "solid", 
                                         color = "whitesmoke"), # format legend
        axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, 
                                   vjust = 1, 
                                   hjust = 1))# angle x labels
  
```


#### Takeaways

* As seen in the original time series, Steelhead were sighted in greater numbers than Coho and Jack Coho most of the study period, suggesting that the population is more abundant or that these fish are easier to count. 
* Once we aggregate the data by year, there do not appear to be any patterns in terms of cyclicality or trends common across species (The monthly variation within a year is hidden).
* Within species, Steelhead populations appear to be trending down, while Coho fish were seen in greater abundance over time, particularly in the last two years of the study period, which could suggest a population increase. Jack Coho fish seem to be present in very low numbers with no change over time, which could be cause for concern.
